                        Hi, my name is <span class="reyhaneh">Reyhaneh</span> and I am here to help you in this game.In
                        this game, we have 6 houses.The computer has chosen a pattern of numbers and you have to solve
                        that pattern with the least possible guesses. After each guess, I will help you to get the
                        correct answer as soon as possible.
                        Pay attention,
                        <span class="green">Green</span>houses means you guessed it right,
                        <span class="yellow">Yellow</span>houses means reduce your chosen number, and
                        <span class="red">Red</span>house means increase your chosen number.
