                    Welcome to the "Guess" game! Hello, my name is Kuki and I am here to help you in this game. In this
                    game, we have 4 houses. The computer has chosen a pattern of numbers and you have to solve that
                    pattern with the least possible guesses.
                    After each guess, I will help you to get the correct answer as soon as possible
                    Pay attention, green houses means you guessed it right
                    Yellow houses means reduce your chosen number
                    The red house means increase your chosen number
                    Do you want to start the game now?
